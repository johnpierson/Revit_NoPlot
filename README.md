# Revit No Plot

##Description
A plugin for Revit that adds no plot functionality to the print method. It can turn off subcategories with a specified identifier (default is "NPLT") or hide individual elements in the views being printed that have the identifier in the type name.

## Dependencies
Uses [RevitCommon](https://github.com/logant/RevitCommon) for Revit UI integration (adding buttons to launch the commands).
